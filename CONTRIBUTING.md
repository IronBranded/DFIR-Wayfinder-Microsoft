# Content Standards

This guide stays useful at scale only if every page follows the same shape. Three templates, used consistently:

## Artifact page (Modules 1–3, 6, 7)

1. **What it is / where it lives** — location, format basics, what generates it
2. **Normal baseline** — what this looks like on a clean, unremarkable host
3. **Red flags** — specific, concrete deviations (name real tool names, real paths, real patterns — not "anything unusual")
4. **How to collect it** — the actual command or tool, not just the tool's name
5. **ATT&CK mapping** — which technique(s)/sub-technique(s) this artifact provides evidence for
6. **Sources** — named, linked where a stable URL exists

See [docs/01-windows-endpoint/prefetch.md](docs/01-windows-endpoint/prefetch.md) as the reference implementation.

## Persistence entry (Module 5)

**Mechanism → ATT&CK ID → where the evidence lives → detection query/approach → cleanup**

## Playbook (Module 8)

**Trigger → Triage questions → Data to pull → Analysis steps → Contain/Eradicate → Recover → Lessons learned**

Playbooks still carry a **Sources** section like every other reference page — cite the methodology (SANS, NIST, MITRE) even though the technical detail is deliberately left to the pages a playbook links into rather than repeated inline.

## Practice Drill (Practice Drills section)

**Scenario → simulated data in the target tool's realistic output shape → a collapsible `??? question "Reveal the answer"` block → what to do next, linked back to the reference pages the drill exercises**

Drills are original, synthetic teaching content, not sourced external material — they don't carry a Sources section the way artifact/persistence/playbook pages do. What they must have instead: every specific technical claim inside the "reveal" block (a GUID, an event ID, a registry path) needs to trace back to something already verified on a reference page elsewhere in the guide, linked directly rather than restated as new fact. A drill should never be the first place a technical claim appears — only where it gets exercised.

## House rules

- Use `!!! success "Baseline"` and `!!! danger "Red flag"` admonition blocks consistently — this is the guide's visual language. Don't introduce new callout types without updating this file.
- Every numeric/technical claim (retention periods, timestamp counts, default settings) should be verifiable against a named source. If you can't source it, mark it as unverified rather than stating it as fact.
- Link sideways aggressively. If a playbook needs to explain an artifact, link to the artifact page — don't re-explain it.
- Scope every page to enterprise IR, not criminal-prosecution procedure, per the guide's stated audience.
- Where a page touches offensive technique categories (obfuscation, evasion, bypasses), stop at the detection signature. This guide documents how to recognize and investigate — not how to build.
